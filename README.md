# ONEScripts

> "Ash nazg thrakatul√ªk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul"

One script to rule them all, one script to find them, One script to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

## OS Version

- Currently only meant to work on CentOS 6+

## Usage

- Basic usage for single scripts: `bash <(curl -ks URL_OF_RAW);`
- These are made to work modularly inside of larger scripts
- They are broken up to make tweaking and updating much easier than a single monolith script
